    # Pages:
    ## Index:
    There is only one page, but 3 different divs and sections are activated and deactivated inside it.

* The Tutorial div:
* What the player i greeted with. It was a small explanation of the game and how to play it. At the buttom of the div there is a "continue" button that closes the div and opens the game-container.

# UX
## Demographics:
* Anybody who likes to play quizes
# Design
I wanted to have everything on one page and the game should be intuitive.
# Controls
The controls is just point and click for both mobile and desktop/laptop.

## Color:
I wanted to have a darker theme to make it easier on the eye and also making it look a bit more modern in my opintion. The text is white and gold to make it easy to see on the dark background. The glowing turquoise borders is ment to give a neon feeling.

# Testing:

* 2023-03-21: The question_count did not change the question when clicking the next question-button, even though the console.log showed that it incremented with +1 for every click on the button.
    I had forgot to return the new value to the funtion that displays the question and answers.

    ```function nextQ() {
        if (question_count == questions.length - 1) {
            alert("End of game");
            console.log(question_count);
        } else {
            question_count++;
            console.log("Another one!");
            showQuestion(question_count); // Forgot about this
            showOptions(question_count); // ...and this
        }
    };
    ```
* 2023-03-21: Manage to increment the score when going the next question, problem is that it always gives a score even if you've picked the wrong answer.
* 2023-03-22: Fixed the scoring. I made a boolean to trigger if the player clicked on the correct answer, and false if incorrect.<br<br>
## Old code:

## New code:
![Image of new code](assets/images/readme-new-code.PNG "Image of new code")Â´

* 2023-03-23: Manage to make use key "5" to go to next question if a answer is selected. Have not manage to select questions with key 1-4.

* 2023-03-23: Manage to select answers with keys 1-4 (I think). But have not manage to make the psudo class "hover" or "active" to trigger.

* 2023-03-23: Found bug where no points is given if answering the last question correct. - FIXED
